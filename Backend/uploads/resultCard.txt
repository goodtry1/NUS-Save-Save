NEWS  &  INFORMATION
Prepared  for  MARY SMITH
DOUBLE SWIPING
All  retail  merchants  in  Singapore  are  required  by  the  Association  of  Banks  in  Singapore  (ABS)  and  the  Card  Schemes  (i.e  Visa  and 
Mastercard)  to  stop  capturing  card  or  cardholder  data  encoded  on  the  magnetic  stripes  of  your  credit,  debit  and  charge  cards .  If     you 
suspect that a Singapore-based retail merchant has done so (e.g. by swiping your card more than once), email ABS at banks@abs.org.sg or 
visit www.abs.org.sg for more details
REVISED MIN PAYMENT
Effective from 1   April 2020,  the minimum  monthly  repayment  for  OCBC  Credit  Cards will  be  revised  from 3% to 1% of the  Total  Statement
Balance (or S$50,  whichever is higher),  for a period of six months.  More information can be found on www.ocbc.com/covid19support
REVISION OF T&CS
From 1   June 2020,  reward points (OCBC$, ROBS$, Travel$,  Voyage Miles)   will be awarded (where applicable)   for every S$5   spent on a  per
transaction basis (instead of  being  awarded  for  each  S$1   spent).    Prevailing rates  for  the  awarding  of  reward  points shall  continue  to  apply
